# Project Description

The Subscription Management System is an internal tool designed for companies to effectively monitor and manage client subscriptions. The system allows employees to track subscription details, update them as necessary, and ensure timely communication with clients. It includes features for adding, editing, and renewing subscriptions, while also providing clear dashboards to visualize subscription statuses. Administrators have full control over system users (employees), ensuring a streamlined process for subscription tracking and updates.

# Project Objectives

1.	Centralized Subscription Tracking: Input and manage all client subscriptions with details such as start and end dates.
2.	Expiration Alerts: Display subscriptions nearing their expiration date in a dedicated dashboard to ensure timely renewal actions.
3.	Renewal Options: Allow users to renew client subscriptions either monthly or yearly and set the new expiration date accordingly.
4.	User Management: Grant administrators the ability to add, manage, and remove employees with access to the system.
